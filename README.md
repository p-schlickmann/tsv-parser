# Tsv Parser ⭐️

It's a python script that extracts information from .tsv files and saves them into a database(data.db). The program is highly reusable beacause it allows the programmer to specify which .tsv file and what columns of that file the programmer wants. You can change those specifications at line 81. It also counts errors and saves them in the table named 'errors'
